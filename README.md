# Alchemy of Algorithms 🌟

Welcome to the Alchemy of Algorithms. Here I try to document my journey of learning algorithms and data structures. I will be solving problems from leetcode mostly and I might sometimes write an article to support a question or to support a concept. I will be using JavaScript and Go for the most part. I will be using JavaScript for the most part because I am more comfortable with it and I will be using Go to learn a new language and to get a better understanding of how things work under the hood. I might usem python for some problems as well.

for a start, this repository is dedicated to only my needs. as I get comfortable with the process, I will try to make it more user friendly and make it useable and beneficial for others as well.


<!-- I will be using the following resources to learn algorithms and data structures: -->
