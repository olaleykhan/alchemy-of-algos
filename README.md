# Alchemy of Algorithms 🌟

Welcome to my Alchemy of Algorithms journey! This repo is my playground for learning and mastering algorithms and data structures. I'll be tackling problems primarily from LeetCode and may occasionally write articles to dive deeper into certain concepts.

For now, this is a one-man show aimed at my own growth. As I get more comfortable, I'll look into making this resource more accessible and beneficial for others.


<!-- I will be using the following resources to learn algorithms and data structures: -->

<!-- - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/)
- [Educative](https://www.educative.io/)

## Languages 🛠

- JavaScript
- Go
- Python (Maybe)

## Folder Structure 🗂

The repository is organized by concepts, with each concept containing solutions in multiple languages. Here's a sneak peek:

```

├── Arrays/
│   ├── Problem1/
│   │   ├── JavaScript.js
│   │   ├── Go.go
│   │   └── README.md

```

## How to Run 🏃‍♂️

Each problem folder will have a README with instructions on how to run the code snippets in different languages.

TODO: devops concept will be implemented to make running the code as easy as possible. I promise it'll be a breeze. that is my own personal devops goal for this project.
