# Recursion.

```
What even is recursion anyway?
we already know that a recursive function is a function that calls itself.
but how so, at what conditions? coes it justy call itself for eternity ?
well, obviously not. there are some conditions that must be met for a recursive function to work.
we look at 2 things when we are dealing with recursion:
1. base case: What is the least amount of work I can do to achieve my goal?
2. break case : when will the process complete? I/E, when will I stop calling myself?
``` 

## Problems\

1. [Factorial](./factorial.js)
<!-- 2. [Fibonacci](./fibonacci.js) -->
3. [Sum of digits](./sumNaturalNumbers.js)
4. [reverseString](./reverseString.js)
6. [isPalindrome](./isPalindrome.js)
