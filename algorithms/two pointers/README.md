# 2 Pointers algorithmic pattern

`
Here, we shall solve multiple questions that primarily use the 2 pointers pattern in it's basic form. no question will have to build on the pattern. just the pattern plain and simple.

`

we shall be solving the following questions:

1. [Valid palindrome](125/valid-palindrome.js) [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/)
2. Pair with target sum    [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/submissions/1073979272/)
3. Find Non-duplicate number instances
4. squaring a sorted array  link : https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/
