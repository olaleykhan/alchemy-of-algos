# Generator functions

Generator functions are functions that can be paused and resumed on the fly, returning an object that can be iterated over. They are useful for creating iterators that can be used in `for` loops.

## Yield statement
the yield keyword is used to define a generator, replacing the return of a function to provide a result to its caller without destroying local variables.
